SUPER SECRET HUSH HUSH TOP SECRET
       FOR YOUR EYES ONLY
	 USAN PERL DISTRIBUTION
==================================

This Visual Studio 2015 Project calls
nmake to build Perl. Do NOT put this 
solution in a path that has spaces in 
the names. That breaks the Makefile 
for some reason.

This should produce a Perl522s.lib and 
several other libraries and object files
all listed below. These are linked in to
UPerl when is built. 

perl522.dll
perl522s.lib
pp_sys.obj
util.obj
win32.obj
win32sck.obj
perllib.obj
